🧠 Smart Exam Attention Monitoring System

Online exams make it difficult to ensure whether a student is actually paying attention. This project is a real-time AI-based attention monitoring system that observes the student through their webcam and gives instant visual feedback based on their attentiveness.

The system detects whether the user is:
👀 Looking at the screen
↔️ Looking away from the screen
🚫 Not present (no face detected)

Based on this, it highlights the video feed in green (attentive) or red (inattentive) and shows an alert when attention is lost.

✨ Features
1) Real-time webcam-based attention detection
2) AI model trained using Google Teachable Machine
3) Green glow when the user is attentive
4) Red glow + alert when the user looks away or no face is detected
5) Confidence level display with smart handling:
6) Reduced confidence when looking away
7) Confidence hidden when no face is detected
8) Dark-themed, distraction-free UI
